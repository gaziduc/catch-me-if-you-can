# catch-me-if-you-can
Catch me if you can is a 2D game (created with Unity) where you must go to the exit without being caught by enemies lights.
There is a solo mode with 3 levels, and a 2-player mode with 2 levels.

If an enemy sees your footprint, warning mode is activated (enemies go faster).
If an enemy sees blood, alert mode is activated (enemies go really faster).

This game has been created in 2 weeks, so please be nice in the comments
